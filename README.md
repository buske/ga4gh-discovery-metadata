# GA4GH Discovery Metadata APIs

The GA4GH Discovery Metadata APIs comprise schemas that defined structured metadata describing entities (e.g. individuals, samples, files) for use with GA4GH Discovery APIs.

**Disclaimer**: this repository is being used to incubate a shared space for metadata definitions. It may go away if it is found to be unhelpful. Please store permanent copies of critical information elsewhere.
